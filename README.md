# The-Gaming-Room

The Gaming Room, a successful application game developer, launched a riddle competition game on the Android platform. To expand the game's reach to multiple platforms and devices, the client needed to create an online version of their existing Android app. I provided a detailed proposal outlining key areas for the client to consider, such as the host operating system, server memory and storage management solutions, API system, security measures, and the benefits of utilizing serverless architecture for product deployment. I made a compelling case for why a cloud platform would be the best choice for the client and their objectives. 


 Analyzing the system model through a UML class diagram proved beneficial in understanding the relationships between entities representing the application components. This helped in designing concise classes with straightforward methods that leveraged the indirect style of other components to create a seamless model. 


 Further exploration of popular operating systems (e.g., Macintosh, Windows, Linux) and mobile platforms could enhance the discussion by delving into the differences between client-side platforms. The primary client-side concern lies with the web browser, as it serves as the main engine running the program for the user. Investigating the distinctions between operating systems for online interactions yielded limited insights. Exploring operating system preferences for specific applications (e.g., Windows for Edge, Mac for Safari) could shed light on whether non-supported apps offer specialized features or performance advantages. 


 The client prioritizes speed and intuitiveness when developing web applications, as user convenience is key to retaining customers. While users may tolerate a less appealing appearance, they are likely to abandon a site if functionality is unclear or sluggish. Understanding client needs is crucial as they are the primary source of revenue for the client. 


 When programming, it is advisable to start with broad goals and progressively refine them for accuracy. Breaking down a client's business objectives into functional requirements that outline the essential components needed to achieve those goals is crucial. Functional requirements can further be segmented into technical requirements that detail the specific approach to enhancing user satisfaction. These technical requirements can then be translated into design documents, architecture, and code that align with the requirements and deliver the final solution.
